            Tackling hunger on the frontline of emergencies is critical, but we
            also need long-lasting solutions. That's why we work with countries
            around the world to help vulnerable people everywhere get the food
            they need to survive and thrive. Our programmes go beyond
            traditional aid models to beat hunger in innovative ways.
            Increasingly, we send cash directly to hungry families because
            they’re the ones who know best how to end their hunger for good.
            When people make their own food choices, it also means they buy
            locally and their community benefits too.

            Every donation we receive makes an impact on a family fleeing

            rebuild their lives.

            Every child, no matter who they are or where they come from,
            deserves access to education. Save the Children, through several
            state-level programmes and national policy-influencing decisions,
            has helped educate 4,06,200 children! We address the learning crisis
            by preparing children and adolescents for life, work, and active
            citizenship.

            Help Flood Victims in Sylhet,<br />
            Bangladesh
          </h1>
          <p>
            As we all may have heard, Sylhet, Bangladesh is experiencing one of
            the worst floods in its history. Over a hundred thousand people over
            the 15 sub-districts in Sylhet are badly impacted. Flood situation
            is getting even worse. This happened due to swelling of major rivers
            caused by continuous rain and rush of waters from the rivers.
